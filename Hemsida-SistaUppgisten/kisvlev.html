        <p>"You look down on us and think we are little better than barbarians, but you should be glad we are, for
            without
            us here, the northern tribes would be dining on the flesh of your children in your burning homes. But for
            the
            courage that flows in our veins would your lands be theirs. Look down on us? You should get on your knees
            and
            thank us every day!" </p>
        <p>â€”Vitalia Kovash, Kislevite Winged Lancer</p>
        <hr>

        <p>
            Kislev, officially the Tzardom of Kislev, also known as the "Realm of the Ice Queen," and to the
            Kislevites
            themselves as "The Motherland," is the most northerly Human realm of the Old World. It is a powerful
            kingdom defined by the constant need to prepare for incessant warfare against the tribes of the
            Chaos-worshipping Northmen on their borders. Kislev is known far and wide for having some of the greatest
            horsemen to ever roam the plains of the southern realms. Ruled by a mighty monarch known as a "tzar" or
            "tzarina," Kislev is a nation born from the saddle, its people's ancestry traced to the mighty
            horse-warriors of the Gospodar tribe who inhabited the Eastern Steppes for many millennia.
            From the Worlds Edge Mountains to the east and the Sea of Claws in the west, Kislev stands at the very
            frontiers
            of Human civilisation in the Old World, a land covered in wide-open steppes and thundering icy rivers, where
            lonely villages stand isolated in the empty wilderness, while mighty cities rise from the landscape like
            great
            islands of stone. The climate is harsh and unforgiving, and only the strongest, most determined people can
            survive here. The inhabitants of Kislev are these very same people, a race of wolf-tough and self-reliant
            warriors, valiant and determined in the defence of their homeland against the hated Chaos Marauders and
            Warriors
            of Chaos of Norsca, the Eastern Steppes and the uppermost Chaos Wastes.

            Since the founding of this mighty kingdom, Kislev has been under siege by the murderous forces of Chaos, a
            realm
            that sits forever at the brink of total annihilation. Countless generations of Kislevites have fought, bled,
            and
            died in the snowy tundra of those harsh northern lands, and it is thanks to these brave Kislevite warriors
            that
            the kingdoms of Men have managed to flourish to the south in the Old World, huddled together in their warm
            and
            safe homes, whilst the sons and daughters of Kislev fight till they draw their last dying breath.
