        <p>"What's Tilea like? Beautiful. Rugged. Poor. Wealthy nobles, ancient city states. Corrupt. There are many
            prejudices, many superstitions. There are many wars. Our men become mercenaries and bandits and
            seafarers..."</p>
        <p>—Katja Murillo to Felix Jaeger, quoting an old book</p>
        <p>"Estalia? That hot, mysterious land topped in mountains, shrouded in mystery, and lying far to the west of
            the Empire. What wicked wind had blown this infidel into town?"</p>

        <p>Tilea</p>
        <p>
            Tilea is a large, fertile peninsula located in the southern Old World, along the tranquil coast of the warm
            and bountiful Tilean Sea.[1m] The wealthy city-states that dot Tilea's landscape share the same cultural
            ideals, embracing the ideals of trade, exploration, progression and civil war with almost equal passion.
            Tilea is a land of great wealth and advancement, a land known far and wide for being the cradle from which
            the ideals of democracy, civil liberty and justice were birthed.[1n] It is only from here that the first
            true republics in the Old World were formed by the region's people, such as the Republic of Remas, while
            others are ruled by a powerful caste of wealthy merchants, known collectively as the Merchant Princes.[1k]
            Tilea is the most powerful of the southern realms, a collection of rival city-states ruled over by their
            mercantile elite who have occasionally tended to follow the lead of Remas, the most powerful of their number
            when the nation was a republic. While it is a land that scorns typical ideas of royalty and nobility, it is
            a hotbed of political wrangling, where careless outsiders may find themselves caught up in the schemes of
            the merchant princes.[7a][24a]

            Yet for all its wealth and advancement, Tilea is, like much of the Old World, a fractious, war-torn region,
            where the fertile countryside becomes the battleground from which legions of mercenaries clash in titanic
            struggles that serve no purpose other than to advance the petty and greedy ambition of the rich and the few.
            As such, it should be no surprise that the greatest concentration of these gold-hungry cutthroats can be
            found in the lands of Tilea. Perhaps it is fitting that these mercenaries are known collectively as the Dogs
            of War.[1h]

        <p>Estalia</p>
        <p>Estalia is a parched realm of Men that is located south of Bretonnia[2a][5a] and south-west of the Empire on
            the Estalian Peninsula of the Old World.[6a]
            Estalia, according to its long and storied history, was the first land settled by humans in the Old World.
            From its dry and arid northern mountain ranges,[3a] to its fertile southern coasts, it is covered in a
            patchwork of ancient kingdoms and proud cities, the greatest of which are Bilbali in the north and Magritta
            in the south, few other cities are known beyond the confines of Estalia itself. The ruling families of these
            rival cities share a long and tangled history that stretches back over hundreds of years and involves a
            great many marriages, assassinations and betrayals of trust</p>
