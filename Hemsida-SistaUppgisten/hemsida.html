            <h2>Introduction to the Warhammer World</h2>
            <p class="intro">Welcome all, and specially for any newcomers! Have you ever been interested in the dark
                background of
                Warhammer, but you've felt you didn't know where to start? Don't worry, we've summarized the history of
                each
                of its races and armies, and we've posted them here for your enjoyment. If you have any questions, ask
                right
                away in the comments section!

                This is a dark age, a bloody age, an age of daemons and of sorcery. It is an age of battle and death,
                and of
                the world's ending. Amidst all of the fire, flame and fury it is a time, too, of mighty heroes, of bold
                deeds and great courage.

                At the heart of the Old World sprawls the Empire, the largest and most powerful of the human realms.
                Known
                for its engineers, sorcerers, traders and soldiers, it is a land of great mountains, mighty rivers, dark
                forests and vast cities. And from his throne in Altdorf reigns the Emperor Karl Franz, sacred descendant
                of
                the founder of these lands, Sigmar, and wielder of his magical warhammer Ghal Maraz.

                But these are far from civilised times. Across the length and breadth of the Old World, from the
                knightly
                palaces of Bretonnia to ice-bound Kislev in the far north, come rumblings of war. In the towering Worlds
                Edge Mountains, the Orc tribes are gathering for another assault. Bandits and renegades harry the wild
                southern lands of the Border Princes. There are rumours of rat-things, the Skaven, emerging from the
                sewers
                and swamps across the land. And from the northern wildernesses there is the ever-present threat of
                Chaos, of
                Daemons and Beastmen corrupted by the foul powers of the Dark Gods. As the time of battle draws ever
                near,
                the Empire needs heroes like never before.
                If you want to know more about the races fighting in these wars, keep reading...</p>

                <h2>The Empire</h2>

                <p>The Empire is quickly becoming the largest and most powerful kingdom of men in the Old World.
                    Still,
                    it
                    is such a vast land that law cannot reach all the hidden recesses of its dark forests and
                    impenetrable
                    mountain ranges. Orcs raid its borders, and the menace of Chaos is growing stronger in the far
                    north.
                    These and other enemies, internal as well as external, must be fought and defeated by the armies
                    of
                    the
                    Emperor if his realm is to survive.

                The Empire was founded over 2,500 years ago by Sigmar, a legendary
                warrior who has become the patron
                deity of this powerful land, now the largest and most technologically advanced nation of men in
                the
                Old
                World. Led by Emperor Karl Franz from his throne in the capital city of Altdorf, the men of the
                Empire
                defend their borders from many would-be invaders: the forces of Chaos from the north, the Orcs
                and
                Goblins from the east and west, and countless others who covet the Empire’s wealth and rich
                farmlands.

                <h2>Bretonnia</h2>
                <p>The knights of Bretonnia are feared and respected throughout the world. Men of valor and honor, they
                    are
                    exceptional warriors and guardians of their land that was founded upon the most heroic of ideals. In
                    the
                    name of the Lady of the Lake and for the glory of Duke and King, they sweep aside evil on the field
                    of battle, for none can stand against their glorious charge.

                Bretonnia is a feudal, traditional land of knights and peasants. The Bretonnian army relies on the
                devastating charge of the knights, who are supported by units of peasant Men-at-Arms. The knights of
                Bretonnia live by a series of vows – these vows uphold the virtues of honor and chivalry. To lose
                honor
                is just about the worst thing imaginable to a knight of Bretonnia, who would rather die with honor
                than
                live without it. The entire society of the Bretonnian nobility is based around upholding the honor
                of
                the self, the King, and the Lady of the Lake (the goddess of the Bretonnians). Individual heroism is
                very important to the Bretonnian knight, and tales of paladins fighting Dragons and of heroes facing
                off
                against countless foes are the kind of things the people of Bretonnia dream of.

                Bretonnia is a feudal society. The peasants serve the knights in return for protection, while the
                knights are obligated to provide military assistance to their lords in return for certain rights (to
                own
                land, to levy taxes, and to receive aid and command military forces in times of war). At the top of
                this
                hierarchy is the King. Beneath the King are the Dukes. Beneath them is another layer of nobility –
                Earls
                and Barons. The King, Dukes, Earls, and Barons are also each the Lord of a number of knights, who
                are
                the lesser nobles. Each knight (including the higher nobles) has a force of Men-at-Arms, chosen from
                the
                most physically able of the peasantry. In return for serving a knight’s standing military force,
                peasants are given a small tract of land for their family. In theory, all commoners can be called
                upon
                by a knight to serve him in battle. However, since many who do not already serve as Men-at-Arms are
                either simple-minded or physically impaired in some fashion, these types of Peasants usually serve
                only
                as bowmen levies. In addition to this earthly hierarchy, the lands of Bretonnia are also ruled over
                by
                spiritual and mystical leaders – the Fay Enchantress, her Damsels, and the Grail Knights – who are
                all
                devoted to the Lady of the Lake.</p>

                <h2>High Elves</h2>
                <p>An ancient and proud race, the High Elves have refined their martial skills and magical prowess
                    over the centuries. As the primitive tribes of man fought amongst themselves, the High Elves
                    navigated the oceans and mapped the heavens. They have watched empires rise and fall, and
                    ferociously repel all who seek to conquer their homeland.
                <p> </p>
                <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DG8pVhMLDjw/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="" width="500">
                <p> </p>
                Deadly, swift, and precise, the power of the High Elves lies in their ability to hit the enemy
                hard where and when they choose with the support of awesome sorcery and devastating missile
                fire. Proud, haughty, and graceful, the High Elf army is well organized and marches to war in
                perfect unity, armored in their strong scale coats, and wielding fine weapons of the highest
                quality.

                Taught the ancient arts of warfare from a young age, the long-lived High Elves of the island
                nation of Ulthuan are masters of both sword and bow. A highly elite force, they are skillful and
                well led, though few in number. A successful High Elf commander must use each of his precious
                units to their full potential in order to win the day.</p>


                <h2>Dark Elves</h2>
                <p>From his dark tower in the distant land of Naggaroth, the Witch King Malekith strikes terror into the
                    heart of every race of the world. Cold and heartless, his armies of Dark Elves launch raids that
                    enslave thousands, while every day, hundreds of his captives are sacrificed on the altars to the
                    Dark God Khaine, Lord of Murder.

                    The Dark Elves march to war from their six menacing fortified cities to enslave the free peoples of
                    the world. The mainstay of a Druchii army is composed of warriors recruited from those cities, who
                    sacrifice blood in the name of their Witch King and sow the battlefields with the bodies of their
                    victims. Nobody is safe from their wrath, for mercy is beyond their comprehension.</p>
